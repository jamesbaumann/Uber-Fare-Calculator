We weren't kidding when we said methods were EVERYWHERE. That "fare estimate" button on the uber app? It's actually a method.

Show off your newly acquired dev skillz to build a command line uber fare calculator.

Uber Estimate's listed prices will help you with valuable pricing information for at least UberX, UberBlack, UberXL, UberSUV.

Hint: Each method should have at least two arguments, one for how far you will go and one for how long the trip will take. To start, turn off surge-pricing (see Next Steps)

Don't forget to test your methods periodically by running `ruby uber-fare-calculator.rb` in the command line.

"The calculator works - I'm done."

Next Steps:

See if your calculator can answer the following questions:

+ "Can we use default arguments somewhere?"
+ "How can you implement surge pricing in your calculator?"
+ "Do all ubers have the same surge pricing multiplier?"
+ "Can your calculator print out which uber is the best option?"
+ "Can you continously determine a fare until the user is done? (e.g. typing in "I'm done with this.")"
+ "How can your calculator tell you whether to take an uber or a yellow taxi?"
